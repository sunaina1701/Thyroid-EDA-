# Thyroid cancer risk data EDA using BioPython

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on thyroid dataset using BioPython. The main goal is to understand patterns, trends, and relationships in the data which can help in better understanding thyroid cancer risk related conditions.

The analysis was carried out in Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook) for easy execution and visualization.
